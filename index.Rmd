# Bio


Karl Veggerby studies freshwater and marine foodwebs. His research focuses primarily on two topics: stable isotopes to study predator-prey dynamics, and otoliths to study past growth rates of fish. He frequently collaborates with colleagues at NOAA and University of Washington School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences. His work has been featured in the "Engineering with Nature" documentary and KGW8 Portland News.
