# ------------------ BIOGRAPHY ------------------

I study freshwater and marine habitats. My research focuses primarily on two topics: stable isotopes to study predator-prey dynamics, and otoliths to study past growth rates of fish. I frequently collaborate with colleagues at NOAA and University of Washington School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences on a diverse array of topics and projects ranging from high altitude spawning streams in Idaho, to oyster farms in the Puget Sound, WA. My work has been featured in the "Engineering with Nature" documentary, NOAA featured stories, and KGW8 Portland News.

# --- LIFE EXPERIENCE SPOTLIGHTS ---

  *	Organized and led 9 separate field teams to do stream surveys in remote wilderness areas of the         Salmon River Basin, Idaho. I taught field crews the basics of field work and a variety of stream
   sampling techniques.
  
  *	I designed and produced a unique eDNA water sampler to solve sampling needs for an project in Lake       Washington. The product was later licensed to a science equipment company. 
  
  *	I co-founded a successful property management company in Seattle, WA, giving me experience with          business accounting, managing a budget, and organizing and executing complex projects.
  
  *	I have a black belt in Kempo Karate, and previously taught martial arts and self defense for several     years.
  
  *	I learned woodworking from my father and I enjoy making custom fine furniture. See my
