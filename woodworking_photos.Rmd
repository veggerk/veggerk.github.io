A slab cherry coffee table. This slab came from a very old tree that died and fell. There was a lot of rot and other damage that had to be accounted for. The butterfly joints in the surface are to prevent cracks from spreading.

A coffee table using fumed white oak. This is a traditional process of darkening white oak wood using ammonia. This process oxidizes the heartwood, which darkens it and creates more of an 'antique' look. It also is a very even stain that penetrates deeper than a modern brushed on stain.

A few framed prints using golden chain tree wood. This is a really unusual species of small ornamental tree that produces incredible hard and beautiful wood.

In this photo I'm using a traditional hand plane to smooth the surface of a board. before the advent of sandpaper, people used a variety of planes to help smooth a wood surface. Finishing furniture like this is more fun than using sandpaper, and can even be faster depending on what type of wood you're using.



We mill most of our own wood from trees that have fallen or are already being taken out. Here are two photos of us milling the elm tree that was used for the elm bed frame.
